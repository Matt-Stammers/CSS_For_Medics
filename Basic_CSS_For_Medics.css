/* Note CSS is supposed to be used WITH HTML so alone this file won't be much use, but it explains the basic concepts.
Thus you need to use the HTML documents as well because HTML adds the content.

First we need to make a link:
This can be done by adding a link tag to the head of your HTML doc: <link rel="stylesheet" href="basic_css_for_medics.css">
*/

h1{
  color: blue;
}

/* This will turn all headers which are h1 blue for instance */

li{
  color: green;
}

/* This will turn all list items green */

h2{
  color: rgb(253,96,0);
}

/* This will allow you to turn all the h2 headers bright orange - look at google colour picker
The numbers are red,green,blue in that order thus rgb()*/

h2{
  color: rgba(253,96,0,0.4);
}

/* This will add whats called an alpha value - this makes the colour less opaque*/

p{
  color: #0895a8;
}

/* This will turn all paragraphs blue using a hex code - this is the most common method*/

/* ok so now we will try backgrounds, borders and start using div and span */

body{
  background: url:"http://www.holidaypic.c0m/wp-content/beach.png;
  background-repeat: repeat
}

div{
  background: blue;
  border-color: red;
  border-width: 5px;
  border-style: dotted;
}

p{
  color: yellow;
}

span{
  background: pink;
  border-color: green;
  border-width: 5px;
  border-style: dotted;
}

/* this will enable you to select only the div, body, span elements and use border as well 
but note the global calls override the div - the p call makes it all yellow regardless
urls can also be imported as can pictures */

/* ok so using id tags and selectors 
to select a div you need to name the class of the div: class="firstDiv" etc */

/* then in the CSS document you can select specific elements */

.firstDiv{
  color: red;
}

.secondDiv{
  color: orange;
}

/* for unique ids you need to use a hashtag */

#uniueqID{
  color: green;
  text-decoration; line-through;
}

/* beware the asterix wildcard. It will override everything except unique ids */

*{
  color:black;
}

/* you can also select multiple more specific combinations of elements */

h4 + ol{
  border: 5px dotted purple;
}

/* this will only get ordered lists immediately after an h4 */

li a[href="www.w3schools.com"]{
  color: yellow;
  border: 6px solid green;
}

/* this will select any anchor tags within a list which meet the nested list criteria for instance/*

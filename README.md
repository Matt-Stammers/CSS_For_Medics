An Introduction to CSS For Clinician Developers

If you want to get started with learning Frontend (or the visibile part of the web) development then CSS is the second technology you should learn. Whilst it is also not a programming language, it will make the content you deploy to your web browser (using HTML) look fantastic! - (that's what CSS does - it makes websites look 'kick-ass'). Ever seen a beautiful site? You can bet that's mostly CSS ;)

Before you get started I recommend you download the Atom text editor: https://atom.io/ as it is definitely the best frontend coding environment I have found (and I have tried out a LOT of them!). It will allow you to keep all your code tidy and help highlight any issues + it features certain predictive abilities which are not to be overlooked.

I also recommend the following resources to learn CSS

Sololearn App - www.sololearn.com - enables you to code on the go.
Codeacademy - www.codeacademy.com
Many of the courses on Udemy / Udacity / or any of the other major platforms are very good, but don't pay for one to learn CSS alone either, it won't be worth the money at this stage.
If you are going to buy a course I can thoroughly recommend Jose Portilla's Full-Stack Development with Django course. When I bought this it was Â£10 and it was honestly one of the best value purchases I have ever made in my life.
There are also numerous web based games that can teach you to code - particularly frontend based ones: https://skillcrush.com/2017/04/03/free-coding-games/

A note of advice: be patient with yourself, it takes time especially when working full time as a doctor. It took me months to get going, but trust me it is well worth it and you will never regret the investment you made in yourself ;)
